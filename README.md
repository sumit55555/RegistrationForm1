1. I made the Registration Form in which such fields are available First Name , Last Name, Mobile Number and Password are present .
2. I make the Web Page in which User can fill all the details and see their name in welcome page through the API which I made with the help of json Server.
3. You can firstly install the Json server-
   ~ npm i json-server
   then run this command by which api started in your local server
   ~ json-server --watch db.json
4.Then open another terminal and run the react project "~npm start"  in different port.
